This is an implementation of the Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS) algorithm in Rust.

COBS is an algorithm for transforming a message into an encoding where a specific value
(the "sentinel" value) is not used. This value can then be used to mark frame boundaries
in a serial communication channel.
See www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing for details.
